# task_manager_expo
Expo task management app

This is the frontend part of my engineering thesis project. Backend can be found [here](https://github.com/FKublin/task_manager_server).

The goal of this project was to create a multiplatform app allowing for tracking and management of project requirements. Client application was created using the Expo platform, which allows for running the app both as a website and as a native application on mobile devices.

To install this application, use `npm i`. To run in browser use `npm run web`; to run on an Android emulator use `npm run android`.
